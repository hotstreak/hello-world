# hello-world

Hey everyone,

I've worked as QA engineer and SQL developer in the past.  I've been running a small auto detailing business the last several years.  I'm eager to get back into development.  I'm currently learning PHP and MySQL.  I've also used javascript a little bit in the past and want to learn more. I'm excited to learn more about the different libraries and frameworks and hopefully start developing real world projects soon.
